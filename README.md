# KASIH
KASIH is an iOS-based breast milk donation platform for mothers and infants in the Jabodetabek region. KASIH employs advanced algorithms to facilitate location-based and preference-based filtration, ensuring precise connections between potential donors and recipients. By implementing an automated verification system for personal data associated with breast milk donation, KASIH ensured the accuracy and authenticity of user information. Moreover, KASIH also simplifies logistics by offering a comprehensive solution for scheduling pickup times and arranging couriers within the platform. By combining location-based and preference-based filtration, digital efficiency, and automated verification, KASIH stands as a professional and reliable platform that facilitates connections between breast milk donors and recipients.

## Why?
According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics from 2023, the proportion of Indonesian infants under six months who received breast milk in 2021 stood at only 52.5%, marking a notable 12% decline from the figures reported in 2019. This could be caused by some factors, including challenges in breastfeeding, insufficient governmental support, and the considerable time required. On the other hand, breast milk is essential for a baby’s immunity and great for a baby’s growth for the first 6-12 months to prevent diseases and stunting.

## Solution Concept
Creating an app that ***simplifies the breast milk donation process*** for ***breastfeeding mothers*** when ***experiencing either insufficient or excess breast milk production***, so ***the number of babies under 6 months that were exclusively breastfed in the Jabodetabek area was increasing***.
